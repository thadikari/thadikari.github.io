## Bio

I am a PhD candidate in Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/draper-s"><strong>Prof. Stark C. Draper</strong></a>.


I received the B.Sc. degree in 2014 from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and the M.A.Sc. degree in 2018 from University of Toronto, Canada. From 2014 to 2016, I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lsegtechnology/about/"><strong>LSEG Technology</strong></a> (formerly known as MillenniumIT), Sri Lanka, primarily on Stock Market Surveillance.


My research interests include distributed optimization, machine learning and source coding. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thadikari"><strong>This</strong></a> is my Linkedin page. Here's a selected set of projects I've worked on (visit <a href="https://www.github.com/thadikari"><strong>Github</strong></a> to see all).

## Projects + Publications



___Two-Terminal Source Coding With Common Sum Reconstruction___
<br>
[[_Paper_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9834771), [_Arxiv_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06973)], _Published_: ISIT, 2022

An information theoretic analysis of the two-terminal source coding with Common Sum Reconstruction (CSR) problem. Each terminal wants to reconstruct the sum of two correlated sources with the constraint that their reconstructions must be identical with high probability. | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thadikari/thadikari.github.io/master/adikari2022two-terminal_banner.png" width="1500" />



___Compressing gradients by exploiting temporal correlation<br>in momentum-SGD___&nbsp;&nbsp;
[[_Paper_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9511618), [_Arxiv_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07827)], _Published_: JSAIT, 2021

A predictive coding based approach for exploiting memory in consecutive momentum-SGD updates vectors. A novel predictor design is proposed for systems with error-feedback. | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thadikari/thadikari.github.io/master/adikari2021compressing_banner.png" width="900" />



___Asynchronous Delayed Optimization With Time-Varying Minibatches___
<br>
[[_Paper_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9429693), [_Code_](https://github.com/thadikari/anytime_minibatch)], _Published_: JSAIT, 2021

TensorFlow-based implementation of SGD on a master-worker system with time-varying minibatch sizes (when workers complete different amounts of work due to stragglers). | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thadikari/anytime_minibatch/master/data/cifar10_all_plots.png" width="900" />



___Decentralized Optimization with Non-Identical Sampling in Presence<br>of Stragglers___&nbsp;&nbsp;
[[_Paper_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053329), [_Arxiv_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11071), [_Code_](https://github.com/thadikari/graph_optimization)], _Published_: ICASSP, 2020

An analysis on decentralized consensus optimization (e.g. optimization on a graph) when workers sample data from non-identical distributions and perform variable amounts of work due to stragglers (slow nodes). | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thadikari/graph_optimization/master/data/archive10_icassp_final_results/run_fashion_mnist_linear1_distinct_PWG_perfect_amb_iclr_10_bern_08_60_10_metro.png?raw=true" width="900"/> <br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thadikari/graph_optimization/master/data/archive10_icassp_final_results/run_fashion_mnist_linear1_distinct_PWG_rand_walk_amb_iclr_10_bern_08_60_10_metro.png?raw=true" width="900"/>



___Efficient Learning of Neighbor Representations for Boundary Trees<br>and Forests___&nbsp;&nbsp;
[[_Paper_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8693043), [_Arxiv_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11165), [_Code_](https://github.com/thadikari/boundary-training)], _Published_: CISS, 2019

This project builds on the "Differentiable Boundary Trees" algorithm by Zoran et. al. proposed in [_this_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08833.pdf) paper. I have posted [_here_](https://github.com/thadikari/differentiable-boundary-trees) one possible implementation of the algorithm. | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thadikari/differentiable-boundary-trees/master/results/nn_tsne_6k.png?raw=true" width="900" />



___Python/NumPy implementation of a few iterative<br>decoders for LDPC codes___&nbsp;&nbsp;
[[_Code_](https://github.com/thadikari/ldpc_decoders)]

Includes implementations of min-sum and sum-product algorithms using sparse matrices (`scipy.sparse`), maximum-likedlood (ML) and linear-programming (LP) decoders, and ADMM decoder. | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thadikari/decoders/master/data/plots/BSC_SPA_compare.png?raw=true" width="900" />
