## About

I obtained both my PhD and MASc degrees from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, Canada, in 2024 and 2018, respectively. During this period, I conducted research on distributed optimization, machine learning, and multi-user information theory under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/draper-s"><strong>Prof. Stark C. Draper</strong></a>.

I received my B.Sc. degree in 2014 from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. From 2014 to 2016 I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lsegtechnology/about/"><strong>LSEG Technology</strong></a> (formerly known as MillenniumIT), Sri Lanka, focusing on the development of technology for Stock Market Surveillance.

Feel free to visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thadikari"><strong>Linkedin</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/thadikari"><strong>Github</strong></a> pages.

I am an enthusiast of rephotography, capturing then-and-now photos. Some selected items from my collection are posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nostalgicapture"><strong>here</strong></a>.

___Exploiting Stragglers in Distributed Computing Systems with Task Grouping___
&nbsp;\-&nbsp; Published in [<span style="color:tomato">TSC '24</span>](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4629386) [[_Paper_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=Exploiting%20Stragglers%20in%20Distributed%20Computing%20Systems%20with%20Task%20Grouping), [_Arxiv_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03645)]


A method is proposed for exploiting stragglers in the context of general workloads, by generalizing standard replication. Evaluations on real-world datasets and clusters show up to 30% time savings. | <img src="assets/img/adikari2024exploiting_banner.PNG" width="1500" />

___Common Function Reconstruction with Information Swapping Terminals (CFR)___
&nbsp;\-&nbsp; Presented at [<span style="color:tomato">ISIT July '24</span>](https://2024.ieee-isit.org/home) [[_Paper_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10619246)]


An achievability and a converse for the the CFR problem is presented, where two terminals swap information and they both reconstruct deterministic functions of sources, which are identical with high probability. | <img src="assets/img/adikari2024common-function.png" width="1500" />

A method is proposed for exploiting work done by stragglers, nodes that randomly become slow in large compute clusters. The proposed method offers up to 30% time savings compared to a baseline. | <img src="assets/img/adikari2023straggler_banner.png" width="1500" />

___Bounds for the Rate Distortion Region of 'Two-Terminal Common Function Reconstruction (CFR)' Problem___

An achievability and a converse on the rate distortion region of the CFR problem are obtained. In CFR problem two terminals approximate a function output, and they must be identical with high probability. | <img src="assets/img/adikari2023bounds_banner.png" width="1500" />

___Two-Terminal Source Coding With Common Sum Reconstruction (CSR)___

An analysis of the CSR problem is presented. In CSR, two terminal want to reconstruct the sum of two correlated sources and they must be identical with high probability. | <img src="assets/img/adikari2022two-terminal_banner.png" width="1500" />
